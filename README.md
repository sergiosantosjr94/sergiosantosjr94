👋 Hi there, I'm [Your Name] — Full Stack Developer & Problem Solver

I'm a software engineer focused on full stack web development, passionate about crafting scalable, modern, and well-architected solutions. Over the years, I’ve worked on impactful projects across different domains, evolving from PHP and jQuery to a modern JavaScript stack with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Prisma, Drizzle, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.

My journey in tech started in a small company in my hometown, where I worked as a technical support specialist. I trained new customers on how to use our ERP system, provided hands-on support, and visited clients to solve IT-related challenges. This role sparked my interest in programming — and once I began learning to code, I never looked back.

I was soon promoted to a developer, building API integrations with marketplaces and automating internal processes. Inspired by that growth, I started my own company, building websites with WordPress, Joomla, and OpenCart — integrating custom features using PHP, HTML, and jQuery.

Recently, I transitioned to the modern JavaScript ecosystem, diving deep into technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, React, Prisma, Drizzle, PostgreSQL, and more. I’ve already built and shipped real-world applications that demonstrate my ability to solve problems and deliver value through code.

🎓 Pursuing My Dream
This year, I earned a scholarship to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science — something I’ve always dreamed of. It’s a new chapter in my journey, and I’m committed to learning deeply, growing continuously, and building high-impact software.

🧠 Lifelong Learner & Mentor
I'm not just passionate about coding — I love helping others grow too. Whether it's sharing what I learn, mentoring newer devs, or collaborating on open-source projects, I believe in growing together.

🌍 Multilingual & Culturally Fluent
I speak three languages:

🇧🇷 Portuguese (native)
🇺🇸 English (C1 – advanced)
🇪🇸 Spanish (B1 – intermediate)
This helps me collaborate across borders, communicate clearly, and thrive in global teams.
